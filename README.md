# React Validated Form Inputs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

This is a fully validated form inputs made with React and Typescript used as form boilerplate. You can use it in your project or start a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with this one, modify the sass variables, add new ones or update the form validators.

The existing validated **input fields** on this repository are:
- Text
- Number
- email
- Select
- Radio
- Textarea
- File Uploader

I suggest to check the form validators located in **@/shared/util/validators.ts**. You can add more validator consts to this file if you need to for your project.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
